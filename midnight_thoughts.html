<h3 style="font-family:verdana;"> Entry 1: 6/27/2022</h3>
<h5 style="font-family:verdana;"> Hello There, it appears you have found my first entry. I'm not sure if this will be a project I soon abandon or if I keep with it. I don't know even if anyone but me will ever read this. Anyways, tonight is going well it is 11:08pm and I am about to head to bed. My gender dysphoria hasn't been that awful as of lately as I got some new clothes, they make me feel quite nice. Other than that I am excited for Gallaudet firstly and secondly for the new episodes of The Orville coming out. I love that show dearly. Anywho I wish you a good rest of your day, afternoon, night, whatever time it is you are reading this I wish you well.</h5>
