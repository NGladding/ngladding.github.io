  <h4 style="font-family:verdana;"> FAQ: </h4>
  <h5 style="font-family:verdana;"> Why did you do this? </h5>
  <p style="font-family:verdana;"> I had a school project that needed a website and I got carried away also my one last brain cell decided to work at 1 am so here I am writing this while most of you are probably asleep. </p>

  <h5 style="font-family:verdana;"> Why a music blog? </h5>
  <p style="font-family:verdana;"> I liked Anthony Fantano's old music blog so I decided to completely rip his idea off and make my own that is VERY similar but also different. Mr. Melonhead if you are reading this pls don't sue me I'm just a broke college nerd.

  <h5 style="font-family:verdana;"> Any plans for the future of this site? </h5> 
  <p style="font-family:verdana;"> I was gonna take it week by week and see how it goes </p>
